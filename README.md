# Badging

In 2012, Mozilla launched their Open Badges project, a verifiable way of issuing digital credentials to people using images.  Intended for use in continuing education, it doesn't appear to have caught on, and Mozilla shuttered its remaining involvement with the project in 2018.

Since the concept could have wider applicability than educational credentials, especially in the Free Software and Free Culture worlds, it seems worth building a minimal implementation of the process, so that projects can issue badges regardless of their adoption in academia.
